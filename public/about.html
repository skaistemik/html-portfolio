<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My initial career started in the accounting field when I graduated from Vilnius College with a bachelor's degree in accounting.
  I have worked in the public accounting sector for about three years. After that I understood that I needed something new in my life.</p>

<p>I have accidentally spotted an ad for Udemy on Facebook for a course in Web Development. 
  I couldn't stop thinking about the course which made me realise that this is a sign to change my life.</p>

<p>I went ahead and bought the course in the middle of my shift in my 8 to 5 job.
  This made me excited again and I wanted to share my achievements in coding with everyone. 
  Hope you like my little projects - I am very proud of them. Especially when thinking that some time ago, still in school, I wanted to be a programmer...</p>

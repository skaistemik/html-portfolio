<h1>The best movies Skaiste watched in her life</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p>An amazing story about the value of human's life.</p>

<h3>The Fight Club</h3>
<p>A movie which I thought I will never watch. This is a story about mental disrorders and how they affect the person's daily actions.</p>

<h3>The Simpsons Movie</h3>
<p>An all-time legend which causes such nostalgic feelings about your childhood and you watching the Simpsons straight after coming back from school.</p>
